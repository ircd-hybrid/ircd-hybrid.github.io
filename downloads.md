## SVN ::

The ircd-hybrid and HOPM SVN repositories can be accessed via ViewVC, and anonymous SVN. They are updated every two minutes. Use SVN versions at your own risk! SVN versions are under active development and usually are not ready for release &mdash; they may not even compile at any given moment. You have been warned!

Anonymous SVN checkout instructions:

We also have a mirror on GitHub which you can use to fork and submit pull requests for review. Be aware that this is only a copy of the working respositories which are not maintained on GitHub.
