## SVN ::

We offer two methods for accessing the IRCD-Hybrid SVN repository: ViewVC, and AnonSVN. They are updated every two minutes. Use SVN versions at your own risk! SVN versions are under active development and usually are not ready for release &mdash; they may not even compile at any given moment. You have been warned!

&raquo; [ViewVC interface](https://svn.ircd-hybrid.org/viewcvs.cgi/)
&raquo; [Anonymous SVN](https://subversion.apache.org/)

AnonSVN instructions:

For latest cutting-edge:
`svn co svn://svn.ircd-hybrid.org/svnroot/ircd-hybrid/trunk`

For 8.2.x:
`svn co svn://svn.ircd-hybrid.org/svnroot/ircd-hybrid/branches/8.2.x`

Remember, these SVN versions are not suitable for production servers!

## GIT ::

We also have a mirror on GitHub which you can use to fork and submit pull requests for review. Be aware that this is only a copy of the working respositories which are not maintained on GitHub.
