-- Noteworthy changes in version 1.1.9 (2020-11-16)
* Implemented support for loading a user-provided private key and tls client
  certificate. The `irc::rsa_private_key_file`and `irc::tls_certificate_file`
  configuration directives have been added for this.
  As a side effect this now allows HOPM to use certificate fingerprints for
  NickServ authentication
* The `vhost` configuration directive found in the irc {} and scanner {} blocks
  has been renamed to `bind`
