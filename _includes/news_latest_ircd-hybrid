#### Noteworthy changes in version 8.2.40 (2022-07-02)
* `channel::disable_fake_channels` now also blocks strikethrough text (0x1E (30))
* `KNOCK` can now be used on private channels. Channel mode `K` may be used instead
  to control whether or not `KNOCK` is allowed on a channel.
* Support for `/dev/poll` has been dropped
* `INFO` now also reports configured values of `channel::default_join_flood_count`
  and `channel::default_join_flood_time`
* The founder `q` and admin `a` channel prefix modes have been implemented.
  These are optional and can be enabled with the new `channel::enable_owner`
  and `channel::enable_admin` configuration directives.
* Channel half-ops may now kick other half-ops
* Extban `$K` of type acting has been implemented. This extban prevents
  matching users from using the `KNOCK` command.
* Server-side channel mode locking `MLOCK` has been implemented
* Fixed server name leak in `WHOWAS` with `serverhide::hide_services` enabled
