#### Noteworthy changes in version 8.2.42 (2022-08-28)
* Added support for reproducible builds using the `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` environment
  variable. See https://reproducible-builds.org/docs/source-date-epoch/ for more
  information.
* Extban `$Q` of type acting has been implemented. This extban prevents
  matching users from using the `KICK` command.
* Implemented channel mode `Q`. `KICK` cannot be used on channels with that mode set.
* Implemented user mode `Z`. Users with that mode set may only receive private
  messages from other users that are connected via TLS.
* Fixed issue where `WHO nick` on invisible clients (user mode `i`) wouldn't work
