#### Noteworthy changes in version 8.2.46 (2025-01-22)
* The user mode subsystem now supports dynamic registration and unregistration of user
  modes. This allows modules to register and unregister their own user modes, making the
  system more flexible and modular.
* The `INFO` command output now includes namespaces, organizing configuration entries
  according to their respective configuration blocks for better clarity and structure
* The `INFO` command output now shows entries from the admin {} config block
* The `WALLOPS` command has been removed
* The `serverinfo::motd_file` configuration directive has been added, allowing the
  Message of the Day (MOTD) file path to be customized instead of hardcoded
* The `channel::max_kick_length` configuration directive has been added, allowing 
  servers to specify the maximum length of a `KICK` message that the server will 
  accept from a client.
