#### Noteworthy changes in version 8.2.44 (2024-06-15)
* Fixed FTCBFS issue caused by ./configure using macros that lacked special handling
  for cross-compilation scenarios
* Fixed the issue where XLINE and UNXLINE were not working properly on servers within
  a cluster
* Command-line options now support both short (`-c`) and long (`--configfile`) formats.
  The available options are:
  * `-c` or `--configfile` for the configuration file
  * `-k` or `--klinefile` for the kline database file
  * `-d` or `--dlinefile` for the dline database file
  * `-x` or `--xlinefile` for the xline database file
  * `-r` or `--resvfile` for the resv database file
  * `-l` or `--logfile` for the log file
  * `-p` or `--pidfile` for the PID file
  * `-f` or `--foreground` to run in the foreground
  * `-v` or `--version` to print the version and exit
  * `-h` or `--help` to display help information
* The new IRC operator flag, `message:mass`, has been implemented. This flag controls
  access to sending mass messages using the `NOTICE $$*.mask` command.
* Upon connecting, a user will now receive a notice with their client certificate
  fingerprint, if provided.
* The `INFO` command now includes the `serverinfo::name`, `serverinfo::sid`, and
  `serverinfo::description` configuration options in its output.
* The `STATS` subsystem has been rewritten to support dynamic registration and unregistration
  of stats handlers. This allows modules to register and unregister their own stats handlers.
* Implemented hostname cloaking API to improve user privacy and security by obfuscating real
  IP addresses. The cloaking process uses CIDR masking, SHA3 hashing, and base32 encoding to
  generate secure and unique cloaked hostnames. The following configuration directives
  have been introduced:
  * `cloak_enabled`: Enable or disable hostname cloaking.
  * `cloak_cidr_len_ipv4`: CIDR length for IPv4 addresses used in hostname cloaking.
  * `cloak_cidr_len_ipv6`: CIDR length for IPv6 addresses used in hostname cloaking.
  * `cloak_num_bits`: Number of bits for the MAC computation used in hostname cloaking.
  * `cloak_secret`: Secret key used in the MAC computation for hostname cloaking.
  * `cloak_suffix`: Suffix appended to the cloaked hostname.
* Added user mode `+x` (cloak) to activate hostname cloaking for the user, replacing their
  real IP address with a cloaked hostname.
* The `INFO` command now includes the new cloaking configuration options in its output. The
  following cloaking-related configuration directives will be shown:
  * `general::cloak_enabled`
  * `general::cloak_cidr_len_ipv4`
  * `general::cloak_cidr_len_ipv6`
  * `general::cloak_num_bits`
  * `general::cloak_secret` (displayed as `<REDACTED>` for security)
  * `general::cloak_suffix`
