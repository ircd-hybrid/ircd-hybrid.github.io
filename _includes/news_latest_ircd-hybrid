#### Noteworthy changes in version 8.2.45 (2024-07-02)
* The module API has been rewritten for improved flexibility. A `modules.conf` file is now
  required for configuring and loading modules. For further information, refer to the
  `doc/reference.modules.conf`.
* The `INFO` subsystem has been updated to support dynamic registration and unregistration
  of info entries. This allows modules to register and unregister their own info entries,
  which are shown in the `INFO` output.
* Added support for a flattened `MAP` output when `serverhide::flatten_links` is enabled.
  This allows users to view a simplified network topology where all servers appear as if
  they are directly connected to the local server.
