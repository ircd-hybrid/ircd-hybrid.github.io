-- Noteworthy changes in version 8.2.36 (2020-12-04)
* The old WATCH implementation has been replaced with IRCv3.2 MONITOR. For this,
  the `general::max_watch` configuration directive has been renamed to
  `general::max_monitor`.
* User mode `B` has been implemented. Clients with that mode set are marked as a
  bot in both `WHOIS` and `WHO`. This mode can only be set by IRC operators (as
  long as the `bot` directive is set in `general::oper_only_umodes`), servers,
  and services.
  This mode can for example be used to mark HOPM as official network bot.
