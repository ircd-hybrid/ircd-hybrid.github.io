#### Noteworthy changes in version 8.2.43 (2022-09-26)
* Due to ongoing protocol modernizations and deprecation of old backwards compatibility
  code, ircd-hybrid is now no longer link compatible to 8.2.33 and below.
  As for the Anope IRC Services, 2.0.8 is the minimum supported version now.
* Implemented channel mode `V`. `INVITE` cannot be used on channels with that mode set.
* `WHOIS` on clients connected via TLS now also shows some details about the TLS version
  and cipher being used
* Removed user mode `d` (debugging notices)
